Terms of Service (AGB)
Last Updated: January 14, 2026
1. Acceptance of Terms
By subscribing to or using the API signals provided by Primate ("Provider"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.
2. Nature of Service (Educational Only)
The Service is a data provider only.
 * No Financial Advice: The signals provided are generated by a proprietary algorithm and are for informational and educational purposes only. They do not constitute investment advice, financial analysis, or a recommendation to buy or sell any specific financial instrument.
 * No Personalization: The data is generic and impersonal. It does not take into account your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, or investment goals.
 * No Execution: We do not execute trades on your behalf. You are solely responsible for any trading decisions you make based on this data.
3. API Usage and License
 * License: We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access the API for your personal or internal business use.
 * Restrictions: You may not resell, redistribute, or republish the signals to third parties.
 * Automation Risk: If you use the API to trigger automated trading ("bots"), you do so entirely at your own risk. You acknowledge that API connectivity issues, latency, or data errors can occur. You are responsible for implementing safeguards (e.g., stop-losses) within your own software.
4. Risk Disclaimer
Trading financial markets (Crypto, Forex, Stocks) involves a high degree of risk and potential for loss.
 * Past Performance: Hypothetical or backtested performance of the algorithm is not indicative of future results.
 * Losses: You acknowledge that you can lose some or all of your invested capital. The Provider is not responsible for any trading losses incurred.
5. Conflict of Interest Disclosure
The publisher of these signals (Primate) actively trades the financial instruments discussed in this service. The publisher may hold long or short positions in the assets mentioned and may open, close, or modify these positions at any time, in accordance with the signals generated by the algorithm.
While we strive to present data objectively, the existence of these personal positions creates a potential conflict of interest. Users should consider this information when making their own trading decisions.
6. Service Availability (SLA)
We strive for high availability but do not guarantee 100% uptime. The Service may be interrupted for maintenance, updates, or technical failures. We are not liable for any losses caused by API downtime or signal delays.
7. Subscription and Cancellation
 * Billing: Subscriptions are billed on a [Monthly] basis in advance.
 * Cancellation: You may cancel your subscription at any time via your account dashboard. Access will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.
 * Refunds: Due to the digital nature of the content (immediate access to data), all sales are final unless otherwise required by mandatory law.
8. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by Austrian law:
 * The Provider shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages (including lost profits or trading losses).
 * Our total liability for any claim arising out of these terms shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the last one (1) month.
9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms are governed by the laws of Austria. The exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes is the competent court in Vienna, Austria, provided the customer is a business entity.
